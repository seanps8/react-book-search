# React Google Book Search

This react app uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and the Google API in order to allow 
users to search for books they would like to read. Users are then able to click `Save` to save to their 
collection. On the `Saved Books` page, users can see all of the books they've saved, and can view or 
delete them in the list.
